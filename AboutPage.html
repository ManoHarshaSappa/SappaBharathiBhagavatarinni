    <h3>Career Journey</h3>

I have garnered significant praise for my performances in Harikatha presentations, with notable recognition at the Vijayanagaram - Shri Mad Ajjada Adibhatla Narayanadasu Garu's worship festivals. My parents, who are both accomplished in the field of Harikatha, guided me and paved the way for my success. I have excelled in my studies under the tutelage of revered gurus and have been actively involved in numerous Harikatha performances.</p>
